No the copy command is executed.

If you try
%ComSpec% /C "xxx"

you will get another error message:

'xxx' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
If you execute
%ComSpec% /C "copy xxx nul"

you get

The system cannot find the file specified.

which is generated by the copy command because it cannot find the file xxx.
